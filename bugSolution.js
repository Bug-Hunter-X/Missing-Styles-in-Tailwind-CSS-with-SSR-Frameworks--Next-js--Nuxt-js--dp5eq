The solution typically involves ensuring correct configuration within your `tailwind.config.js` file.  The `content` array must accurately reflect where Tailwind should search for your template files. Here's an example:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [ 
    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Make sure this includes all directories that contain your components or pages that use Tailwind CSS classes.  Also, verify that your build process correctly compiles Tailwind CSS after processing your templates.  If using a framework like Next.js, ensure that Tailwind is correctly configured within the framework's build process. In addition double-check your paths.  Incorrect paths in `tailwind.config.js` or incorrect import statements in your components can also lead to these issues.
