This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js that uses server-side rendering (SSR).  The issue arises because Tailwind's JIT (Just-In-Time) mode requires that your CSS files are compiled during the build process. If the build process fails to correctly include or compile your Tailwind CSS files, or if the paths to those files are incorrect, then you may encounter missing styles or unexpected rendering behaviour. This is often manifested as styles not being applied to elements as expected, even if your Tailwind classes seem correct in your components.  Another potential problem is incorrect configuration of `content` option in `tailwind.config.js` file, leading to Tailwind not picking up your template files, resulting in missing styles.
